# Data Structure and Algorithm

Language: Java

Another repositories of mine are also about DSA:

- APS (Algorithm Problem Solving): https://github.com/anhtuta/aps
  - This is a DSA course when I worked at Samsung R&D Center
  - This repo used `C/C++` language, and I had to build my own data structure using pure `C/C++` code, such as: stack, queue, hash, linked list, trie, sort, binary search
- Applied Algorithm (thuật toán ứng dụng): https://github.com/anhtuta/c-cpp
  - This is an algo course when I was a student at HUST, mainly focus on algorithms, such as: backtrack, greedy, divide and conquer, dynamic programming
